    <!-- 1. Acceptance of Terms -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
      <p>
        By downloading, installing, or playing <strong>Flit</strong> ("the Game"), or by creating an
        account, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to
        these Terms, do not use the Game.
      </p>
      <p>
        These Terms constitute a legally binding agreement between you and the developer of Flit
        ("we", "us", or "our"). We reserve the right to update these Terms at any time. Continued
        use of the Game after any update constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
      </p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          <strong>Age requirement:</strong> You must be at least 13 years old to create an account
          and use Flit. If you are under 13, you may only use the Game with verifiable parental or
          guardian consent. See our <a href="privacy.html">Privacy Policy</a> for details on
          how we handle data for younger users.
        </p>

    <!-- 2. Description of Service -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Description of Service</h2>
      <p>
        Flit is an immersive geography-based flight game available on iOS, Android, and the web.
        Players pilot a virtual aircraft across a rendered globe, identifying countries, cities, and
        geographic features from aerial clues. The Game uses real satellite imagery (NASA Blue Marble,
        public domain) and open-licence geographic data to deliver an educational and entertaining
        experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        An account is required to play. There is no guest mode. Your account saves progress, scores,
        and statistics across all your devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        We reserve the right to modify, suspend, or discontinue the Game or any part of it at any
        time, with or without notice. We are not liable to you or any third party for any
        modification, suspension, or discontinuation of the service.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 3. User Accounts -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. User Accounts</h2>
      <p>
        To play Flit you must create an account using a valid email address and password. You are
        responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all
        activity that occurs under your account.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You must provide accurate and complete information when creating your account.</li>
        <li>You may not share your account or credentials with any other person.</li>
        <li>You must notify us immediately if you suspect unauthorised access to your account.</li>
        <li>
          You may delete your account at any time from the Profile screen within the app. Account
          deletion permanently removes your email, username, and all associated game data within
          30 days.
        </li>
        <li>
          We reserve the right to suspend or terminate accounts that violate these Terms, without
          prior notice.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- 4. User Conduct -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. User Conduct</h2>
      <p>
        You agree to use Flit only for lawful purposes and in a manner consistent with these Terms.
        You must not:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Cheat or exploit</strong> — Use hacks, bots, scripts, modified clients, or any
          automated means to gain an unfair advantage in the Game or to manipulate scores and
          leaderboards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Use inappropriate usernames</strong> — Your username must not contain hate speech,
          slurs, profanity, sexually explicit language, or content that impersonates another person
          or entity. We may change or remove usernames that violate this rule without notice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Abuse or harass</strong> — Use the Game or any associated features to harass,
          threaten, intimidate, or otherwise harm other users.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Reverse-engineer</strong> — Attempt to decompile, disassemble, or reverse-engineer
          any part of the Game, including shaders, game logic, or server-side code.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Interfere with the service</strong> — Take any action that disrupts or overloads
          the servers or networks supporting Flit, including denial-of-service attacks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Commercially exploit</strong> — Sell, rent, or otherwise commercially exploit any
          part of the Game without our prior written consent.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Violation of these rules may result in immediate account termination and, where applicable,
        reporting to relevant legal authorities.
      </p>
    </div>

    <!-- 5. Virtual Currency -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Virtual Currency &amp; In-Game Items</h2>
      <p>
        Flit may include an in-game currency ("Coins") and other virtual items earned through
        gameplay. The following terms apply to all virtual currency and items:
      </p>
      <div class="card">
        <p>
          <strong>No real-money value.</strong> Coins and virtual items are provided for use
          within the Game only. They have no monetary value outside the Game, cannot be exchanged
          for real money, goods, or services, and are not transferable between accounts.
        </p>
      </div>
      <ul>
        <li>Virtual currency and items are licensed to you, not sold. You do not own them.</li>
        <li>
          We may modify, reset, or remove virtual currency or items at any time — including in
          response to exploits or changes to game balance — without compensation.
        </li>
        <li>
          If your account is terminated for violation of these Terms, any accumulated virtual
          currency or items will be forfeited without refund.
        </li>
        <li>
          Any in-app purchases (if offered) are subject to the applicable platform's terms
          (Apple App Store or Google Play). All sales are final except as required by applicable law.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>

      </p>
      <div class="highlight">
        <p>
          <strong>Third-party assets with open licences:</strong> Flit uses satellite imagery from
          NASA (Blue Marble, Earth at Night) and elevation data from ETOPO, all of which are in the
          public domain. Geographic boundary data is sourced from Natural Earth (public domain) and

          you any additional rights to the Game as a whole.
        </p>
      </div>
      <p>
        By creating an account you grant us a non-exclusive, royalty-free licence to store and
        display your username and display name in connection with in-game leaderboards and similar
        game features.

      <p>
        Your use of Flit is also governed by our

        reference. By agreeing to these Terms, you also agree to the Privacy Policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In summary: we collect only what is necessary to run the Game — your email address,
        username, and game statistics. We do not sell your data, serve advertising, or use
        third-party analytics SDKs. Error telemetry contains no personally identifiable information.

      <p>
        The Game is provided on an <strong>"as is" and "as available"</strong> basis, without
        warranties of any kind, either express or implied, including but not limited to warranties
        of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.
      </p>
      <p>
        We do not warrant that the Game will be uninterrupted, error-free, or free of viruses or
        other harmful components. Geographic data is provided for entertainment purposes only and
        may not reflect current political boundaries, place names, or real-world conditions. It
        should not be relied upon for navigation or any other practical purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        Satellite imagery and geographic data are sourced from publicly available datasets (NASA,
        Natural Earth, OSM, GeoNames) and are used in good faith. We make no warranty as to their
        accuracy, completeness, or currency.

    <!-- 9. Limitation of Liability -->
    <div class="section">
      <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
      <p>
        To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, we shall not be liable for any indirect,
        incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, including but not limited to loss
        of profits, data, goodwill, or other intangible losses, arising out of or in connection with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Your access to or use of (or inability to access or use) the Game;</li>
        <li>Any conduct or content of any third party in connection with the Game;</li>

        Our total aggregate liability for any claims arising under these Terms shall not exceed the
        greater of (a) the amount you paid us in the twelve months preceding the claim, or (b)
        USD $10.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain warranties or the limitation of
        liability, so some of the above limitations may not apply to you.

      <p>
        Your continued use of Flit after any change to these Terms constitutes your acceptance of
